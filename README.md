# DynGan and DynGAN-LSTM implemenation

we recomend using the linked colab notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18g2SDV39mzNfqN366FU_N9dxj1-LAd7x?usp=sharing

this implementation combines the two models but it is pssible to seperate them.

To view the predicted results in a GUI download the attached directories.</br></br>
To run the trainning process please run graph_gan.py.</br></br>

Below is an example of running the GUI:
